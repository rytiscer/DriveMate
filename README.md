# DriveMate
DriveMate - The internal system of a car rental company is a web application designed to streamline the car rental process. This system allows managing cars, clients, orders, and service events in one place.

The system provides the following key features:

- Car Management: Ability to view, add, edit, and delete cars.
- Client Management: Manage client data, add new clients, edit or delete existing ones.
- Order Management: Create new orders, view, edit, or delete existing orders. Each order assigns a car to a client, and the rental price is calculated based on the period the client plans to rent the car.
- Car Service: Register service events, such as technical inspections or oil changes. This helps track the technical condition of cars and plan future maintenance work.
The system is built using Framework 1, Framework 2, and Framework 3. You can find the project code and detailed instructions on the Github platform.
