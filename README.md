# DriveMate

DriveMate is an internal system designed for a car rental company to streamline the car rental process. This web application allows managing cars, clients, orders, and service events in one place.

## Key Features

- **Car Management**: Ability to view, add, edit, and delete cars.
- **Client Management**: Manage client data, add new clients, edit, or delete existing ones.
- **Order Management**: Create new orders, view, edit, or delete existing orders. Each order assigns a car to a client, and the rental price is calculated based on the period the client plans to rent the car.
- **Car Service**: Register service events, such as technical inspections or oil changes. This helps track the technical condition of cars and plan future maintenance work.

## Getting Started
